# Announcement: Discontinuation of Free Bots for Bybit 
I regret to inform that I will no longer be updating or maintaining my free trading bots for the Bybit exchange. This decision comes after a deeply disappointing experience with Bybit's unethical practices, particularly regarding their affiliate program and their handling of user earnings.

Despite fully complying with Bybit's rules, including completing KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, my affiliate earnings were abruptly terminated without valid justification. Bybit cited "one IP address" as the reason, a claim that is both unreasonable and unfair, especially for users in shared living environments or using shared internet connections. This behavior demonstrates a lack of transparency and fairness, and it has eroded my trust in Bybit as a reliable platform.

As a result, I have decided to shift my focus to [BingX](https://bingx.com/invite/HAJ8YQQAG/), a more transparent and user-friendly exchange that aligns with my values of fairness and integrity. Moving forward, I will be developing and updating trading bots exclusively for [BingX](https://bingx.com/invite/HAJ8YQQAG/), and I encourage my community to explore this platform as a viable alternative to Bybit.

I want to thank everyone who has supported my work and used my free bots for Bybit. Your trust and feedback have been invaluable, and I hope to continue providing value to the crypto community through my future projects on [BingX](https://bingx.com/invite/HAJ8YQQAG/). Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance during this transition.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
